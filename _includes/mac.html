<ol>
<li><b>A spreadsheet program</b>
<br>For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have
Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set!
<br>
If you need a spreadsheet
program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install
instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.
       <ul>
          <li><b>Download the Installer</b>
        <br>Install LibreOffice by going to the <a href=https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/>installation page</a>. The version for Mac
should automatically be selected. Click on the button below "Main Installer" <b>Download Version x.y.z</b>. You
will go to a page that asks about a donation, but you don't need to make one.
Your download should begin automatically.
          <li><b>Install LibreOffice</b>
            <br>Once the installer is downloaded, double click on it and it should install.
<li>To use LibreOffice, double click on the icon and it will open.
</ul>

<p>

<li><b>R</b>
<br>In the workshop, we will use RStudio. RStudio is a nice interface to the
programming language R. To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href=http://cran.r-project.org>CRAN</a> and click on <i>Download
R for (Mac) OS X</i>
<li>Select the .pkg file for the version of OS X that you have and the file
will download.
<li>Double click on the file that was downloaded and R will install
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">RStudio Download page</a>
<li>Under <i>Installers for Supported Platforms</i> select <b>RStudio <em>x.yy.zzz</em> - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)</b> to download it.
<li>Once it's downloaded, double click the file to install it
<li>Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any error messages.
</ul>

<p>
  
<li><b>R packages</b>
<br>We will use several R packages in the course, which you can install before the course.<ul>
<li>Open RStudio
<li>In the box named <b>Console</b> type: <code>install.packages("tidyverse", "gridExtra", "dbplyr", "RSQLite")</code>.
  <li>Test that the packages were installed correctly by typing: <code>library(tidyverse); library(gridExtra); library(dbplyr); library(RSQLite)</code>. 
    This might print some text, but as long as you don't get a message starting with the word "Error", then everything should be fine.
    If you have problems, we can try to help you during the course.
</ul>
