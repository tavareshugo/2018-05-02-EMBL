<h2>Course Description</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
<a href=http://datacarpentry.org>Data Carpentry</a> workshops are for any researcher 
who has data they want to analyze, and no prior computational experience is required. 
This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more 
effectively with data. 
</p>

<p>
From astronomy to molecular biology, our increasing capacity to collect data is changing science. 
It allows us to ask questions that previously could not have been answered, and it changes the 
impact that science has on society. Although petabytes of data are now available, most 
scientific disciplines are failing to translate this sea of data into scientific advances. 
The missing step between data collection and research progress is a lack of training for 
researchers in crucial skills for effectively managing and analyzing large amounts of data.
</p>

<p>
Data Carpentry addresses this gap by teaching researchers the fundamental data skills they 
need to conduct their work. Our goal is to provide researchers high-quality, domain-specific 
training covering the full lifecycle of data-driven research. We teach hands-on workshops in
data organization, management, and analysis to increase data literacy and improve research 
efficiency. Our domain-specific approach allows us to tailor the data, content, and tools 
to reflect the specific data and analysis needs of different areas. Domain specificity also 
allows us to build new skills on knowledge frameworks familiar to learners, and to motivate 
workshops using real scientific questions and data relevant to the learners’ field of study. 
This approach allows learners to see immediate value in the skills they are learning and to 
put new techniques immediately into practice.
</p>

<p>
A workshop can’t teach a researcher everything they need to know about data management and analysis, 
however it drastically reduces the barrier to entry and imparts the skills for continued learning 
and engagement. Our ultimate goal is to enable data-driven research in diverse disciplines by 
creating strong communities of data scientists and empowering them to conduct more innovative 
and effective research.
</p>


<h2>General Information</h2>
  
<p>
On the first two days of this workshop we will cover basic skills in data organisation and 
analysis, primarily focusing on the statistical and programming language R.
On the third day we will introduce more advanced data analysis methods with 
applications to genomic research (although any researcher with an interest in 
multi-dimensional data might also benefit from the materials covered on this day).
</p>

<p>
Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. 
By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and 
analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their 
ongoing research.
</p>

<!--
  AUDIENCE

  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers in the life sciences 
  who would like to learn good practices in data management and analysis. 
  Students need not have any prior experience in computational research, but some 
  familiarity with working with tabular data on a computer is welcome. 
  We create a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable data driven discovery.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
  section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
  and end easier to find.

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  The software required for this Data Carpentry workshop will be installed 
  on the computers at our training venue.
<p>
However, if you want to use your own laptop, you will need working copies of the 
described software. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download 
the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants can bring and use 
their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow 
once you leave the workshop.
<p>
Please follow these <a href=install.html>Setup Instructions</a>.

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>
